# react-build-config
React Build with Webpack et al. This is currently a WIP. As I work through this I will remove the beta flag and better document for future use.

  * sourcemaps work on prod -- make prod build and run local server while debugging prod
  * class properties
  * .babelrc is used by CLI ES6 Modules
  * ./config/babelrc.js is used by webpack
